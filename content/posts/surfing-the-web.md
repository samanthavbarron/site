# Lizards.com
People used to use the internet to explore. I used to go on [StumbleUpon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StumbleUpon) for hours when I was little, or hop around different pages on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page). I think the desire to surf the web explains [Depths of Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depths_of_Wikipedia).

When I was maybe six years old, we had a computer room that was a small nook that had a small window overlooking our back yard. It could have been an attic if it was unfinished but it was this cute little place with a desk that wrapped around two of the walls and bookshelf built into the walls. It was really small with vaulted ceilings. Definitely my favorite room of that house.

Anyway, my cousins were visiting and we were on [Surfing the Web](/posts/surfing-the-web). At some point we were about to leave, but my cousin said "wait, hold on, I want to check something". He typed [Lizards.com](https://lizards.com/) into the URL bar and hit enter.

It gave some kind of error and he said "dang, I guess the internet doesn't have lizards". I want to go back to that form of the internet.

# Surfing in 2024
It seems like there's a resurgence of people on the internet that want to go back to the way things were on the internet. The way that we use technology has changed, and I think people want something else, [I know I do](/posts/phones-bad). So what does surfing the web look like in 2024? It didn't really occur to me until recently that *you can still do this*.

Here are a few entry points I've found to doing this:
- Research [Digital Gardens](/posts/digital-gardens)
- Find and [use](https://omnivore.app/) [RSS](https://rss.32bit.cafe/i/) feeds
	- Hint: [Substack Publications have RSS feeds](https://support.substack.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038239391-Is-there-an-RSS-feed-for-my-publication)
- Browse [now.garden](https://now.garden/)
- Find people/communities on [Mastodon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(social_network))
- **Contribute!!!**
	- Make an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) page with [Publish](https://obsidian.md/publish)
	- Make an [omg.lol](https://omg.lol/) page
