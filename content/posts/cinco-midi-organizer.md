We can only assume that in the above product demonstration, the CMO is being stretched to its computational limits, as Cinco has a large tech branch where [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8K6QUPmv8Q) [showcase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEW5b5ZtaV0) [new](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-o7YG3x0DI) [technologies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9S2ciB-6jc).

There are $\sim180$ digits in the Cinco MIDI Organizer’s (CMO) UMRN (Unique Midi Routing Number). This means it can index as many as $10^{180}$ MIDI files. That means if you filled up the CMO with that many MIDI files of $1$ second each, the duration of your CMO library would be $10^{162}$ times the age of the universe.

If the CMO is actually able to sort a list of that many elements, it needs to perform at least $10^{180}$ operations. Let’s say for every atom in the universe, we have a CPU running at 1THz. Even if we could do these operations all in parallel (we can’t), it would still take all of the CPUs $10^{70}$ ages of the universe for our $10^{80}$ CPUs to finish.

Because this operation is not reversible, the CMO will need to expend energy. At the time of writing, the [fastest CPU](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu.php?cpu=AMD+EPYC+9655P&id=6354) consumes about $400$ Watts under typical conditions, and has $192$ threads. Therefore, the CMO is estimated to consume $10^{80} \cdot 400 / 192 \sim 10^{80}$ Watts under typical load. Thankfully, that T-38 Scsi port packs a punch, and as we see in the demo, it's able to accomplish this in a matter of seconds.

In this humble living room, this family just consumed $\sim 10^{80}$ Watt-seconds (or Joules) of energy. That's $10^{61}$ times the energy produced in all nuclear testing conducted by humans. This incomprehensible amount of power sits in a beige box, doing exactly what its creators asked it to do.

The Cinco MIDI Organizer is the most powerful weapon mankind has ever created. It not only destroys everything that there is, but it also destroys everything that ever was or ever will be. The recklessness of mankind to create such a god-killing machine is a testament to humanity’s inevitable self-destruction.
