Around 2010 I met someone named Yineli on [Last.fm](https://last.fm) through commenting on each others' profiles. We had very similar music tastes, and she introduced me to [Blue Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Foundation) and [Portishead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portishead_(band)).

Eventually we moved off talking on Last.fm, and decided to share MP3s in a shared DropBox folder. Once every month or so for about a year we would add some MP3s in a folder, along with a text file with a message to the other about the music we were sharing.

Eventually we fell out of contact, but I think about it often, and it still makes me happy thinking about it.
